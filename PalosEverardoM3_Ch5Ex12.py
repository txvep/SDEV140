"""
When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
d = ½gt²

The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
Write a function named  that accepts an object’s falling time (in seconds) as an argument.
The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. 
Write a program that calls the function in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.
